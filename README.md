This is a project about integrating a Back-End functionality to an already existing Front-End application. 

The functionalities are as follows:

- CRUD Methods to a MySQL database utilizing Sequelize
- Routes for interactions with said database
- MSC structure with Object Oriented Programming utilizing TypeScript
- Docker integration for program versioning during development
- The front-end in this case is purely hypothetical, no functionality has been implemented
